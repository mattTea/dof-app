RTF is an open source training platform that hosts hands-on exploitation, remediation, and secure coding exercises.  In each exercise candidates manually find and remediate the code of a vulnerable application running in a disposable development environment accessed using a web browser. The platform allows to add new exercises, setup time-boxed tournaments where points are used to rank candidates on a leaderboard. Metrics are provided at candidate, team and organisation level indicating remediation ratio and time spent on each type of vulnerability. Metrics allow to measure real competency in secure coding and remediation and quickly identify and address gaps.",
